## Hurricane information:

   - On average, the diameter of hurricane-force winds is about 100 miles(160 kilometer). Slower speed winds further out from the storm center increase the storm system's diameter on average 300 to 400 miles across. And the eye of the hurricane is 30 miles in diameter.(https://www.directenergy.com/learning-center/hurricane)
